        <p>My name is Fiona Herzog.</p>
        <p>
          I am an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania with
          a double major in <em>Computer Science &amp; Communications</em> with a
          concentration in <em>Data &amp; Network Science</em>.

          I am passionate about utilizing digital tools to convey research, news
          stories and analysis of the world around us. Feel free to click through
          the work I have done.

      <h3>The Long Story</h3>
      <bodycopy>
        <p>
I am a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying two majors that are seemingly unrelated to get the best of both worlds -- technical skills to convey my understanding   of the world around me. At Penn, I have worked hard to find communities to merge my interests to develop meaningful and impactful projects. 
From Daily Pennsylvanian, I have come to understand how politics and economics work together to influence Philadelphia. Not only have I been able to document this influence with words, I have also been able to convey this influence with data analysis and graphs. 

At Penn Spark and 34th St, I am able to engage with creative projects that exercise my ability to express myself in way that other people can understand and relate to. I’ve been able to tie my love for film by being a Film & TV Beat writer for 34th St while making a mini-game centered around film for Spark.

I firmly believe that with the technical skills I have aquired through computer science, I have been able to unlock a new set of tools to express myself creatively. With my background in political science, communication, and design, I hope to tell the necessary stories of our world. 
When I am not on my computer, I am knitting and exploring Philadelphia. I love art galleries, experimenting with sandwhich combinations, and talking to my mother over the phone. ♥
